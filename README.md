# Recipe Demo
A simple recipe app built with React and Vite.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies as defined in the `package.json` file.

## Development

To start the development server with Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server with hot module replacement (HMR), allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy or test the production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds your React project for production and outputs the results in the `dist/` directory.

## Contributing

1. **Fork and Clone:** If you're a new team member, start by forking the repository and then cloning your fork.

2. **Create a Branch:** Before you start making changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

Replace `my-new-feature` with a descriptive name for your changes.

3. **Commit and Push:** After making your changes, commit them and then push the branch to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

4. **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the main repository on GitHub and open a new pull request from your branch. Request a code review from a teammate.

5. **Review and Merge:** Once the PR is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the main branch.

## Best Practices

- Keep commits small and focused. Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- Write clear commit messages describing the changes.
- Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting your work.
- Regularly push your branches to GitHub to avoid losing work and to keep your teammates informed.
- If you introduce a new dependency, make sure it's necessary, well-maintained, and added to the `package.json` file.

## Issues

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions, please open an issue in the GitHub repository, providing as much detail as possible.
